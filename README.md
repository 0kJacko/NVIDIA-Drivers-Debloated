## Removing your current driver

You can skip this step if you are on a clean install of windows with no graphics driver or if you are installing a new graphics card.

Enter safe mode by clicking win + r and typing msconfig then tick the safe mode box and reboot into safe mode and when you are booted into safe mode repeat this process but untick safe mode.

Open [DDU](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html) and Select GPU on the right hand side of the program and then click Clean and restart.
